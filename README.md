# Zettelkasten command [Under Development ðŸš§]

A personal zettelkasten program.

Currently works on MacOS, and suits my needs, but currently it is not
extensible (can't be used in other environments, can't add custom
editors, etc).

### Full Text Search Implementation (for fun purposes)

1. Use rg to full text search your notes, then render the html
   corresponding that fetch, use `htmx` to help you achieve this
   behaviour


### Dependencies:

- `nvr`
- `rg`
